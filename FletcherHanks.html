      My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1977566438" target="_blank">3 of 5 stars</a><br>
      <p>Fletcher Hanks created some goofball comic book stories. This collection is an oddity. It is a beautifully produced, well researched, hefty hardcover filled with the complete works of an obscure comic auteur, but don't expect too much. The revelations are amusing but not really amazing. Fletcher was influenced by the work all around him, particularly Flash Gordon, Dick Tracy and Sheena of the Jungle. He absorbed his influences and spit them out in a warped, fun house mirror style. Along the way, there is some enjoyable and unexpected weirdness. Unfortunately he never transcends second rate status. His writing is clunky and his art is stiff. If you are looking for inspired and weird comic book stories, you would be better off with Steve Ditko or Jack Cole.</p>
