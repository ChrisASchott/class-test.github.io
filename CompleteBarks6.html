        My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3273451312">4 of 5 stars</a><br>
        <p>Carl Barks (1901- 2000) is a legendary cartoonist, though for much of his career he was anonymous, as were all Walt Disney comic book artists. He started as an animator at Disney Studios in 1935, but quit in 1942. Before quitting, he moonlighted as a comic book artist. After leaving Disney Studios he approached Western Publishing in 1943 and became a regular contributor to “Walt Disney's Comics and Stories” and other comic book titles. Fantagraphics has collected the Carl Barks Donald Duck stories in a series of beautiful hardbound books. “The Old Castle’s Secret” is Volume 6 of 22. With clean, crisp line art and bright color, it is hard to believe that the material was originally printed in 1948, though some story aspects seem dated.</p>
        <p>The title story is the highlight of the book. In his second appearance, Uncle Scrooge whisks Donald and his three nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, off to an adventure in a haunted castle in Scotland. In this story, it is easy to see the seeds of the “Duck Tales” cartoon show that ran from 1987 to 1990. “Life is like a hurricane here in Duckburg…” Barks invented Duckburg and much of the supporting cast including Gladstone Gander, the Beagle Boys, Gyro Gearloose and Magica De Spell. Donald’s nephews were created before Barks’ comic book career by writer Ted Osborne and cartoonist Al Taliaferro. It was Barks, however, who elevated them to star status.</p>
        <p>In the title story and most others, the nephews are depicted as brave and resourceful. They typically take the initiative and often save Donald from his own mistakes. That’s why “Spoil the Rod” stands out as conspicuous; the nephews in this story are terrible brats. Other stories that seem out of synch include ”Darkest Africa” which is blemished by terrible racial caricatures and mistreatment of animals. I looked at the story notes in the back of the book, expecting to see the racism addressed, but it wasn’t examined in detail. We are told that for a long time this story was not reprinted in English. For foreign editions, the art was altered and the dialog changed to remove the racist aspects. I haven’t found a rationale for why the Africans were even depicted as humans in a universe otherwise populated by anthropomorphic animals.</p>
        <p>Following the comic stories are nineteen pages of story notes with some pages dedicated to reprinting the original comic book cover images. The notes are a mixed bag; there are some interesting insights but some just don’t add much. After that is a brief but interesting biography of Barks.</p>
        <p>I noticed that Huey, Dewey, and Louie were often depicted with differently colored hats and wondered if it was a way to distinguish between them. I found on Wikipedia that, “It wasn't until the 1980s when it became established that Huey is dressed in red, Dewey in blue, and Louie in green.“ That may be helpful in a future trivia contest. For another neat bit of trivia, check out the story, “Spoil the Rod”, in which the nephews’ middle names are revealed.</p>
        <p>All in all this is a fun and entertaining collection of a comics master. Carl Barks was an excellent illustrator, a peerless draftsman and an inventive storyteller. The 226 pages go by quickly and leave you wanting more. Don’t worry, Fantagraphics has 21 other volumes.</p>
