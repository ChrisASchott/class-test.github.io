      Crammed full of over the top sex and violence, this book collects the Cannon comic strip by Wallace Wood. It originally appeared in The Overseas Weekly, a tabloid sold exclusively on U.S. military bases. Pure male fantasy, John Cannon is an unstoppable fighting and killing machine working as a secret agent for the United States government. Emphasis is on the action, no characters are given much depth. The Overseas Weekly was not subject to the Comics Code Authority, nor seemingly any restrictions, and Wood makes the most of it.</p>
      <p>Women are mostly props who spend most of their time unclothed. They are all drawn with the same bodies, differentiated visually by face and hair style. Many are femme fatales working for an enemy or otherwise duplicitous. They all fall under the spell of Cannon's allure. They are variously tortured, shot, beaten and called bitch. There seems to be an ugly underlining assumption that when they're hit, they deserved it. You might say it's a product of it's time and meant for a particular audience. You might say it's blatantly misogynist. </p>
      <p>Wood is deservedly a cartooning legend and his illustration abilities are enviable. He does so much with a brush, a pen and black ink. He creates human figures in every possible pose with beautiful backgrounds and a variety of textures. It seems that there is nothing he can't draw; cars, weapons, explosions, and naked women who look mostly alike.</p>
      <p>Recommended for Wood fans, but know what you're getting into.</p>
