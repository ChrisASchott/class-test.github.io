<p>Everybody loves Mickey Mouse, right? Yet how many really know Mickey Mouse? Most people can tell you what he looks like, but how many could describe his personality? Compared to Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck, Mickey is fairly nondescript. Even within his own world, Mickey is one of the least interesting, with characters like Donald and Goofy stealing the show. He has largely been portrayed as well-meaning, if bland. At most he has been the little guy who stands up against bullying oppressors. So… nice, sometimes heroic, but mostly boring? Much of Mickey’s understated personality is the result of his becoming the official symbol of the Walt Disney Company. He has become more a logo than a character.</p>
<p>Before Mickey became a branding icon, he first made an appearance in the animated short “Plane Crazy” in 1928. He made his official debut in “Steamboat Willie” later that year. His daily newspaper strip began in 1930 and ran for 45 years. Floyd Gottfredson is credited with most of the work on the strip, though, from the start, it is branded with Walt Disney’s distinctive signature.</p>
<p>Fantagraphics has collected the entire run of the Mickey Mouse comic strip and they’ve done a suitably polished job. I have the first two volumes, covering 1930 to 1933. They are beautiful hardbound books presented together in a sturdy slipcase. The wide format showcases the strips at what is probably their original size. Imminently readable, there are three dailys per page with generous margins. Each book contains extensive scholarly articles examining Mickey’s history and enduring legacy.</p>
<p>Drawing from a wide variety of influences, including their contemporary newspaper strips and movie serials, the comics generally place Mickey in the center of an adventure. In these pages, Mickey is brave and resourceful, though not above getting even. Like Chaplin’s tramp, he is the little guy we root for. He encounters thieves, pirates and cannibals among other adversaries. Ironically, Mickey has more of a voice than in his early film appearances. While he maintains his lively pantomime gesturing, he is given sizable word balloons to propel the stories along.</p>
<p>People unfamiliar with early Mickey Mouse may be surprised at how he is sometimes depicted. He is not above violence or revenge. He uses guns and mistreats less anthropomorphic animals. In one startling run, he keeps trying to commit suicide. This storyline was suggested by Walt himself, who believed that the failed attempts would be great for laughs. Even with all of this, however, Mickey remains somewhat generic as a character. He is an everyman, not an outsized personality.</p>
<p>I came to these comics knowing about Carl Barks’ work on Donald Duck. Barks is held in high esteem and his work is often cited by comics historians and enthusiasts. He also told adventure stories and introduced most of Donald’s supporting cast. Unfortunately, Floyd Gottfredson is simply not Carl Barks and these comics never quite rise to the same level. These strips are good, but clearly a distant second to the Barks Donald Duck.</p>
<p>I have enjoyed these first two volumes and will undoubtedly revisit them from time to time. There are fun discoveries and surprises within these pages, but ultimately Mickey is not a remarkably compelling character. I feel no need to collect the further editions of the series.</p>
