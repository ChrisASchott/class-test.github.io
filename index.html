My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3275778734">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This is another beautifully produced hardbound edition in Fantagraphic’s “The Complete Carl Barks Disney Library”. It is volume 7 of 22 and the second one I’ve added to my shelf. As it is with the previous volume, the reproductions of material from 1948 and 1949 seem flawless. The line art is crisp and the color is vibrant. Carl Barks was a great cartoonist. He packs a lot of expression in the faces and bodies of his characters. His stories are fun and engaging. Unfortunately, also like it’s predecessor, this collection is marred by some racial caricatures. I understand the commitment to showing Barks’ work as it appeared originally, but it does diminish my enjoyment of the material.<br /><br />The title story is again the highlight and apparently Barks’ own favorite. It’s another globe trotting adventure tale, this time taking Donald and the nephews to a remote and mysterious kingdom hidden in the Andes. Circumstance contrives to elevate Donald from fourth janitor at a museum to its primary explorer. His mission? To discover the source of square eggs! Of course, being Donald Duck, victory is neither simple nor certain. This adventure to a faraway land is reminiscent of Hergé’s Tintin stories, though I can’t find evidence that either influenced the other. <br /><br />Most of this book is fun for all ages. Then there is <i>Voodoo Hoodoo</i>. In this story we encounter ugly racist depictions of African people. Again I wonder why Barks couldn’t have stuck with three fingered anthropomorphic animals and left humans out altogether, but there they are, big lipped and wide eyed. They seem either sinister and menacing, or uneducated and foolish. The story notes in the back of the book don’t seem to acknowledge the extent to which this is disturbing. I give Mr Barks a pass as he belonged to his time and place, but I expected more from the notes.<br /><br />There is also some racism in the preceding story, <i>Race to the South Seas</i>. The Polynesian natives are not distorted like the Africans, but they are shown as awfully primitive. Was it really this way in 1948? At one point a native spouts some obviously invented gobbledygook and another, some hokey broken English. “Him got white feet like you fella massa!” The notes actually praise the depiction of the natives and seems to ignore the more problematic aspects.<br /><br />Like the previous volume, this book has story notes and some cover images in the back. This book also adds an introduction that focuses on Barks’ career history. The bulk of the book is divided into three parts: "The Adventures", "The Short Stories" and "The Gags". Barks’ shorter pieces are fun enough, but his longer form tales are where he really excels. I might have preferred a greatest hits collection of his best longer adventure stories.
