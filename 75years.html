        My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/297537955" target="_blank">5 of 5 stars</a><br><br>
        <p>This book will really be on my "Currently Reading" list in perpetuity. It's a gigantic treasure trove (chest?) of all things DC Comics. At 12.5 x 3.5 x 18.2 inches, 16.9 pounds and 720 pages, this is easily the most massive book in my collection. This is more than just a doorstop, though; there are years worth of entertainment within its pages.</p>
        <p>While there are longer articles sprinkled throughout, it's not one single thread from start to finish. It's mostly a collection of comic book images with brief, but detailed captions for each that include credits, dates and descriptions. Most of the real estate is given to the pictures, a great percentage of which are larger than the original publication size. Most of the images are covers, pages and panels, but there are preliminary drawings and sketches. There are historic photos of readers, creators, toys, and behind the scenes of television and film.</p>
        <p>Pages seem thick and sturdy. Section heads are even thicker, with a silver foil treatment. Each section has pages that unfold to reveal timelines four pages wide. The contents are arranged chronologically with these sections: "The Stone Age", The Golden Age", "The Silver Age", "The Dark Age" and "The Modern Age". Those are followed by an afterward, a selection of biographies and a pretty extensive index.</p>
        <p>This monumental tome is not something to consume all at once, or even to follow front to back. This is a book you will continually revisit, jumping back and forth through time, discovering new little nuggets all along the way. It has a bookmark ribbon, but you may not ever use it; you can open to any page and find something of interest. Will anyone ever read the whole thing?</p>
